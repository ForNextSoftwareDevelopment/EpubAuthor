# EpubAuthor
Change the name of the author in a folder with epub files.

I recently bought me an e-reader and noticed that the epubs I placed on it (which are on my pc in folders by author name) all had slightly different authors listed in the epub itself.
Sometimes 'name sirname' or 'sirname, name' or.....

So I wrote a little program that alters the epub and changes the name of the author to that of the folder name.
Be sure  to make a copy of the epubs before using the program, as I said it rewrites the 'opf' file in the epub.
